<p>
	<strong>Collaborative telepresence</strong> is one that has many impacts with the <em>education factor</em>. Some of which are:-
		<ul>
		<li>
			<strong> Helping students who are facing adversity </strong>:- By using collaborative telepresence, it can allow students who are momentarily not available to attend their classes physically by being engaged remotely. Within the education system, we are faced with students who are unable to attend classes due to unavoidable instances. Whether it be due to a sickness, an accident or even a family emergency, the incapability to not attend classes can negatively impact a students academic performance. In other cases they might have to be held back another school year in which may result in an extra fee being paid to accomodate the student another year.<br><br>
			The right solution would be to implement the collaborative telepresence within institutions for not only is it<strong> <em>flexibile</em></strong> and<em><strong> beneficial</strong></em> to students who can't physically be at school but it can also increase the passing rate and would not have any students falling behind as well as money can be saved to be used for more important matters. Even though instructors require some training to utilize the system into the classes, its actual use is relatively easier for instructors than extending deadlines, changing assignments, or scheduling alternate exam days.

	</ul>

</p>

<p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong> Elimination of expenses </strong>:- With the telepresence there is not much moving up and down that needs to be done so the expenses would have decreased drastically. Without the telepresence whether by bus or by car money is still being spent to attend school and with the telepresence that is indeed eliminated.
