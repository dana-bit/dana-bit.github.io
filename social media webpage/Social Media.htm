	<strong>Social Media </strong> is a website or an application which allows user to create and share content. Collaborative telepresence, however, is one that impacts social media as well. This is by:- <br><br>
	<strong>Live video streaming:-</strong> Live video streaming is becoming an increasingly popular form of interaction in social media, with mobile devices being used for sharing of remote situation "on the go." We are interested in how such forms of interaction can be applied to collaborative telepresence that means a quick and effortless way of having users at a remote location, where they can share each others' viewpoints and participate. We developed an application that achieves such effect by taking advantage of spatial data inferred from mobile devices' onboard sensors and embeds realtime video streams into panoramic mixed reality displays. To validate our solution we conducted a preliminary study and observed a statistically significant decrease in cognitive workload as well as increase in spatial and situational awareness among users in comparison with a regular telepresence application. Believing in the novelty of our approach, we plan to extend our application with environment mapping and empathic interface functionality.
