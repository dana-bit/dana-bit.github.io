	Like anything else in this world, not everything is perfect. Here, we will be highlighting the <em><strong>negatives</strong></em> that may come forward with the usage of Collaborative telepresence. These may be:-<br><br>
	<ul>
		<li><strong> No physical interactions:-</strong>People miss out on the visual clues provided by other peopleâ€™s body language, for example, which can sometimes be more revealing than what they are actually saying. Some cultures prefer the business card exchange and handshake while performing businesses.</li><br>
		<li><strong>Technical Difficulties:- </strong>Collaborative telepresence may decide to stop working halfway through a meeting or call. Dropped connections, camera malfunctions and choppy video streams can quickly make a collaborative telepresence frustrating or useless. It is also worth noting that although telepresence may work out to be cheaper than travelling to meetings, it is by no means free. Companies could pay quite a lot for a good quality reliable system and software, and still more to keep it maintained.</li><br>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Time difference:- </strong> Time differences between different locations in the world means it is virtually impossible to find a reasonable time for everyone. Which may in the long run be a drawback.</li><br>
		<li> <strong>Expensive equipments:-</strong>In order to do collaborative telepresence, it is needed to buy the necessary equipment however this is a drawback because for the best technology in telepresence it is very costly for the best equipment to get the best performance.</li>
	</ul>
